## What is TestNG?  TestNG is a testing framework inspired from
but introducing some new functionality that makes it more powerful and easier to use.

It is an open-source automated testing framework; where NG of Test NG means Next Generation.
 TestNG is similar to JUnit but it is much more powerful than JUnit but
still, it's inspired by JUnit. It is designed to be better than JUnit,
especially when testing integrated classes. Pay special thanks to *Cedric Beust who is the creator of TestNG*.

TestNG eliminates most of the limitations of the older framework and
gives the developer the ability to write more flexible and powerful
tests with help of easy annotations, roupingg, sequencing &
parametrizing.

ANNOTATIONS  IN TESTNG

 ***Types Of TestNG Annotations

In TestNG, there are ten types of annotations:

-@BeforeSuite*** - *The `@BeforeSuite` method in TestNG runs before the execution of all other test methods*.
- ***@AfterSuite*** - *The `@AfterSuite` method in TestNG runs after the execution of all other test methods*.
- ***@BeforeTest*** - *The `@BeforeTest` method in TestNG runs before the execution of all the test methods that are inside that folder*.
- ***@AfterTest*** - *The `@AfterTest` method in TestNG executes after the execution of all the test methods that are inside that folder*.
- ***@BeforeClass*** - *The `@BeforeClass` method in TestNG will run before the first method invokes of the current class*.
- ***@AfterClass*** - *The `@AfterClass` method in TestNG will execute after all the test methods of the current class execute*.
- ***@BeforeMethod*** - *The `@BeforeMethod` method in TestNG will execute before each test method*.
- ***@AfterMethod*** - *The `@AfterMethod` method in TestNG will run after each test method is executed*.
- ***@BeforeGroups*** - *The `@BeforeGroups` method in TestNG run before the test cases of that group execute. It executes just once*.
- ***@AfterGroups*** - *The `@AfterGroups` method in TestNG run after the test cases of that group execute. It executes only once*.
